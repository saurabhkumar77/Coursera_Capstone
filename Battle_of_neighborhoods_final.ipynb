    "## Introduction & Business Problem :\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Toronto, is the most populous city in the Canada. It is diverse and is the financial capital of Canada. It is multicultural. It provides lot of business oppourtunities and business friendly environment. It has attracted many different players into the market. It is a global hub of business and commerce. The city is a major center for banking and finance, retailing, world trade, transportation, tourism, real estate, new media, traditional media, advertising, legal services, accountancy, insurance, theater, fashion, and the arts in the Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that the market is highly competitive. As it is highly developed city so cost of doing business is also one of the highest. Thus, any new business venture or expansion needs to be analysed carefully. The insights derived from analysis will give good understanding of the business environment which help in strategically targeting the market. This will help in reduction of risk. And the Return on Investment will be reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "A restaurant is a business which prepares and serves food and drink to customers in return for money, either paid before the meal, after the meal, or with an open account. The City of Toronto is famous for its excelllent cuisine. It's food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city's immigrant history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants - bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes, and delicatessens\n",
    "Jewish immigrants and Irish immigrants - pastrami and corned beef\n",
    "\n",
    "Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses are ubiquitous throughout the city\n",
    "mobile food vendors.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is evident that to survive in such competitive market it is very important to startegically plan. Various factors need to be studied inorder to decide on the Location such as :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Population\n",
    "2. Demographics\n",
    "3. Competitor \n",
    "4. Crime Rate profile\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyse the dataset in order to recommend a borough to standup Indian Resturant. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "The success criteria of the project will be a good recommendation of borough/Neighborhood to stand up an Indian Resturant based on Lack of such restaurants in that location and nearest suppliers of ingredients."
